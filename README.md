# Introduction

### Data Science Project: Predicting Heart Disease with Classification Model Based on Physical Features

**Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
The ability to accurately predict the presence of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes by facilitating early intervention and treatment. 
Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, can be invasive and expensive. 

Therefore, developing a predictive model based on non-invasive physical features could greatly benefit both patients and healthcare providers.**

### Goal

**The primary goal of this project is to create a classification model that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on various physical attributes. These attributes include age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators obtained through blood tests and exercise tests. The target variable is binary: 0 indicates no presence of heart disease, and 1 indicates the presence of heart disease.**

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 14 physical attributes collected from patients through blood tests and exercise tests. These attributes include:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (4 categories)
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl)
- Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise induced angina
- Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
- The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- Target: 0 for no presence of heart disease, 1 for presence of heart disease



Import Necessary Libraries: Load essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Understand the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
Model Building: Create and train a classification model using appropriate machine learning algorithms.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
Conclusion and Future Work: Summarize the findings and suggest potential improvements and future work.
