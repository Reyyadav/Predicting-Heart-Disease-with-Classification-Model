# Data Science Project: Predicting Heart Disease with Classification Model


### Introduction
***Heart disease is a major global health issue, accounting for a significant percentage of deaths each year. Early detection and intervention are critical for improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, while accurate, often involve invasive procedures and high costs. This project aims to develop a predictive model using non-invasive physical features to identify the presence of heart disease. The model will be based on a classification approach, leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.***

### Goal
- The primary goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various physical attributes.
- These attributes include age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators obtained from blood tests and exercise tests.
- The target variable is binary:

      0 indicates no presence of heart disease
      1 indicates the presence of heart disease.

### Dataset
- The dataset used for this project consists of 14 physical attributes collected from patients through blood tests and exercise tests.
  The attributes are as follows:

- Age: The age of the patient.
- Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female).
- Chest pain type: Categorized into 4 types (1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic).
- Resting blood pressure: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.
- Serum cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.
- Fasting blood sugar: Whether fasting blood sugar is > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
- Resting electrocardiographic results: Values 0, 1, 2 (0: normal; 1: having ST-T wave abnormality; 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
- Maximum heart rate achieved: Maximum heart rate achieved during the test.
- Exercise induced angina: Whether the patient experienced angina during exercise (1 = yes; 0 = no).
- Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment: Values 0, 1, 2 (0: upsloping; 1: flat; 2: downsloping).
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy: Ranges from 0 to 3.
- Thalassemia: A blood disorder (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect).
- Target: The presence of heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes).

### Methodology

1. Import Necessary Libraries
- The first step involves loading essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset by analyzing the distribution of variables, identifying missing values, and visualizing relationships between features.


### Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values through imputation or deletion.
- Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Normalize numerical features to ensure that all attributes contribute equally to the model.


3. Model Building
- Create and train a classification model using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- The choice of algorithm will be based on the dataset's characteristics and performance during initial testing.


4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as:

- Accuracy: The proportion of true results among the total cases examined.
- Precision: The proportion of true positive results among all positive results predicted by the model.
- Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive results among all actual positive cases.
- F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

### 5. Conclusion and Future Work

- Summary of Findings: Summarize the results, highlighting the effectiveness of the model in predicting heart disease.

- Potential Improvements: Suggest ways to enhance the model's performance, such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or using more advanced algorithms.

- Future Work: Propose future directions for this research, including the integration of more diverse datasets or the application of deep learning techniques for further accuracy improvement.


***This project has the potential to significantly impact healthcare by providing a cost-effective, non-invasive method for early heart disease detection, ultimately saving lives and resources.***
